# alphagraphics-blueprint
A project to learn web development. The aim is to create a web based form to sumbit orders to be processed by the associate in charge of the department. The goal is to have a space for the:
Company Name
Project Name
Queue Number
Ink Color
Size
Binding
Pickup-Delivery
Order Status
Email

Plans for post-completion are integration with QuickBooks and the OurPlanRoom upload site to streamline the entire process. The form will also populate a page with the order status allowing anyone in the company to know the progress on a customer's order. There will also be a feature allowing an email to be sent notifying the customer their order is ready.
