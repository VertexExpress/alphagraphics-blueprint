# alphagraphics-blueprint
A project to learn web development. The aim is to create a web based form to sumbit orders to be processed by the associate in charge of the department. The goal is to have a space for the:
<br>Company Name
<br>Project Name
<br>Queue Number
<br>Ink Color
<br>Size
<br>Binding
<br>Pickup-Delivery
<br>Order Status
<br>Email

Plans for post-completion are integration with QuickBooks and the OurPlanRoom upload site to streamline the entire process. The form will also populate a page with the order status allowing anyone in the company to know the progress on a customer's order. There will also be a feature allowing an email to be sent notifying the customer their order is ready.
